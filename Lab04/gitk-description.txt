The top middle subwindow:
This shows all the commits(by name) on the left
Who committed it (by name and email) in the middle
And the date and time committed on the right

The bottom left subwindow:
This shows the ChangeLog with a search bar above it
It also shows the patch file beneath if you scroll down.

The bottom right subwindow:
This shows the comments for the patch
(it is usually pretty sparce from what I can see)


The top window allows you to navigate through all the commits
to find the one you want to look at. It also shows a timeline
+ branch summary on the far left. This allows you to see the
different branches going on at any moment and where the
specific commit was done.

The bottom left allows you to read the Changelog and the patchfile.
This is extremely useful and is most likely the reason you used
gitk in the first place.

Finally, the bottom right shows you the comments that the patchfile has.
This is a good way to communicate with other contributors.
This shows which files were changed, which is also useful.

Also, there are numerous search bars/options/dropdown menus that allow you
to navigate the gui better.
