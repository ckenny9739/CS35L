Install openssh:

dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Now both of them are installed and I am good to go.

Generate public and private keys:
ssh-keygen

I bypassed the passphrase by just hitting enter instead
of entering a passphrase.
It gave me my own randomart image to identify me.
It is a rectangle with different characters in it.

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/ubuntu/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
f2:93:08:8e:33:e8:95:cc:db:53:08:77:d5:0c:cd:dd ubuntu@ubuntu
The key's randomart image is:

Find IP and try communicating via IP:
ifconfig
(Found IP by looking for 10.97.85.xyz
Found xyz for me to be 120)

My IP address is 10.97.85.120

ping 10.97.85.120

This sends packets of information until I press Ctrl-c
That means that this worked!!

My partners IP addresses are:

10.0.2.15 (She is on her own computer so the beginning is different)
10.97.85.102

Setting up the server:

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo useradd -d /home/usersfolder -m username
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo passwd username
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successful
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ cd /home/u
ubuntu/      usersfolder/
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ cd /home/usersfolder/
ubuntu@ubuntu:/home/usersfolder$ sudo mkdir .ssh
ubuntu@ubuntu:/home/usersfolder$ sudo chown -R username .ssh
ubuntu@ubuntu:/home/usersfolder$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh
ubuntu@ubuntu:/home/usersfolder$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

I created the usersfolder directory to house my users
I created the username username
I set the password to password
I changed the ownership and permissions
I changed PasswordAuthentication from yes to no
This lets us disable password-based authentication

I logged in to my partner's server using the following:
(his username was 'kum' and IP was 10.97.85.102)
This basically copies the public key over the sever and adds private key

ssh-copy-id -i kum@10.97.85.102
ssh-add

I ssh'd by doing both the regular and the -X versions:
ssh kum@10.97.85.102
ssh -X kum@10.97.85.102

I opened xterm on the -X version
(-X is necessary to have the xterm screen show up)
by typing in:
xterm

It opened!! Everything seems to be working
(It also works with firefox so we are all set).

Finally I typed in the following to set home to be used by client:
chmod o-rwx "$HOME"
