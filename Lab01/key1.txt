Explaination of keys:
For my computer C-c is done by pressing CTRL and c.
M-c is done by pressing ESC and c.

Lab:

1. How can you get man to print all the commands that have
a specific word in their man page (or at least the
description part of the man page)? (hint: man man)
m a n SP - K [insert word here]
Example: man -K Square

2. Where are the cp and wc programs
located in the file system?
w h e r e i s SP c p
w h e r e i s SP w c
OR
l o c a t e SP c p
l o c a t e SP w c

3. What executable programs have names that are just
one character long, and what do they do?
l o c a t e SP - b ' ? '

4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic
link /usr/bin/cc, which file actually is executed?
l s SP - l SP c c

5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file.
What does the symbolic mode g-s mean, in terms of permissions?
m a n SP c h m o d
/ g - s

6. What option to find lets you search for files
that have been modified in the last 3 days?
f i n d SP - m t i m e SP - 4

7. Use the previous answer to find all directories
modified in the last 3 days.
f i n d SP - m t i m e SP - 4

8. Of the files in the same directory as find,
how many of them are symbolic links?
f i n d SP - t y p e SP l 

9. What is the oldest regular file in
the /usr/lib directory?
l s SP - t r l SP | SP h e a d

(Use head so that we can easily see the oldest 10 files)

10. Where does the locale command get its data from?
m a n SP l o c a l e

(Questions 11-14 were completed by searching through emacs itself.
There are no specific keystrokes. The answers to the questions
are in ans1.txt. Emacs is run by typing emacs)

11. In Emacs, what commands have sort in their name?
Found using documentation command index.
This is found by going to emacs
Going to manual and then command index.

12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-a
through C-z do? Can you list their actions concisely?
Found using documentation key index.
This is found by going to emacs
Going to manual and then key index.

13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do?
Found using documentation key index.
This is found by going to emacs
Going to manual and then key index.

14. What does the Emacs yank function do?
Found using documentation concept index.
This is found by going to emacs
Going to manual and then concept index.

15. When looking at the directory /usr/bin,
what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command,
and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command?
l s SP - l
AND
C - x 	C - d

1.5:

CREATING THE FILE:
c d ~ Enter m k d i r SP j u n k
c d SP j u n k
t o u c h SP h e l l o . c

COMPILING THE FILE:
M-x c o m p i l e Enter h e l l o Enter

C-x b h e l l o - o u t Enter C-u M-! . / h e l l o Enter

COPY AND PASTING THE TEXT INTO LOG
C-x h M-w
[Switch to log]
